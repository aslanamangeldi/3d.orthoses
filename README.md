Effectiveness of our scientific project in practice: cost-effective improvement of biomechanical function of broken or damaged limbs of citizens of Kazakhstan.
Creative homogeneity: creating a hypoallergenic orthosis with an aesthetic appearance in a short period of time by interpreting biological functional knowledge using 3D printers in the STEM room of the Nazarbayev Intellectual School in the direction of physics and mathematics, Shymkent.
The relevance of our research project: to enable citizens of Kazakhstan with physical disabilities or functional limitations to live a normal and productive life. The main goal of our research project is to improve the life and health of citizens of Kazakhstan by replacing the traditional medical plaster with a modern hypoallergenic orthosis.
Social significance: An increase in the number of updates in the field of health care (medicine); Providing financially and economically affordable orthosis for citizens of Kazakhstan.
 
Types of orthoses
Orthosis for immobilization exerts static force on a specific part of the body. An example of this would be an immobilized wrist joint in wrist orthosis. The orthosis has no moving parts, and the wrist joint itself is at rest in the orthosis. On the other hand, orthoses for mobilization are assembled with movable components and can be customized depending on the specific type of construction and the purpose of the orthesis. Orthoses for mobilization can be further divided into dynamic, static progressive and serial static orthoses. When wearing dynamic orthoses, the elastic components that allow the patient's joint to move are hypoallergenic soft fabric and small Spurs. This orthosis aims to speed up the postoperative treatment event to help weak muscles or increase the passive range of joint movement. Static progressive orthoses include inelastic components that usually involve hard joints or other dense tissue to allow for progressive changes in joint position. It is an effective intervention when someone's joint is very stiff after an injury or surgery.
The serial static orthosis is worn by the patient for a period of time and then reconfigured to adapt to positive changes.
Our choice was hypoallergenic orthosis, which combines two categories. Advantages: affordable (cost-effective); can be consumed many times; easy to remove, does not require air passage and tissue. However, there are also few points that require improvement, knitting on a 3D printer takes a long time, you need to look for ways to improve the knitting material, and optimize the way to fix hypoallergenic fabrics.
Innovative hypoallergenic orthoses sewn using a 3D printer, a plaster replacement apparatus that has no analogues today in its price/quality combination. Light and does not hinder movement. It is not afraid of water, you can swim with it both in the bath and in the sea. The material allows oxygen to pass freely, which does not cause itching, irritation or other skin reactions in the patient.
3D printing, also known as complementary manufacturing (AM), has revolutionized the field of orthopedics, allowing healthcare providers to create personal medical devices faster, easier, and more efficiently.  Using 3D scanning data, the AM device
 
allows you to accurately adapt to the unique physiology of the patient at minimal cost and in significantly less time than traditional production methods. 3D printing has been used in orthopedics to create ankle orthoses, orthopedic insoles, spinal Staples, head orthoses, etc.
The level of control that can be achieved through 3D printing can increase the patient comfort level and the performance of the device, especially when developing biologically important designs that cannot be created by traditional methods. AM also eliminates the need for the expensive tool traditionally required to make custom orthoses, and has high scaling, making mass ordering more economical. At the same time, through rapid development cycles, AM provides rapid design duplication and improved fit.
Another advantage of orthoses sewn using a 3D printer is that they allow you to provide more dynamic behavior compared to traditional designs. For example, you can create hard and flexible areas with the same design and perforation to improve breathing and hygiene.
Clinical studies have shown that special orthoses for the wrist, arm, foot and ankle have a similar or higher effect on biomechanical and kinematic parameters, while providing a higher level of user satisfaction and comfort than normal orthoses.![Uploading image.pngâ€¦]()

we can say that the research project has been supplemented with an orthosis device, a modern medical new product that replaces traditional plaster. It can be seen that orthosis is very effective not only for fractures, but also when the joints slip and come off.
Thanks to innovation and enthusiasm for improving the lives of patients, our journey into the world of orthopedics has reached its climax. This comprehensive study, which involves the use of advanced 3D printing technologies, paved the way for a future that promises to change the idea of orthopedics. As we enter this last chapter, we take a look at the past and focus our eyes on the opening horizons of possibilities.
Our research project began with a simple but in-depth question: How to alleviate the discomfort and inconvenience of patients using traditional plasters? This question has generated passion in us, and as a result of careful research, experiments and collaboration, we have become pioneers in developing a new solution that overcomes the limitations of traditional orthopedic care.
At the heart of our path is the miracle of modern innovations that changed the idea of Orthopedics-the use of 3D printing technology. With this powerful tool in the Arsenal, we got rid of the limitations of traditional orthopedic production. With a deep understanding of Blender, NTop, and implants, we have overcome the boundaries of what is possible by creating orthoses with unparalleled precision and efficiency.
Our innovative approach allowed for several key innovations:
1.patient-centered Orthopedics: the integration of 3D printing technology has opened a new era of patient-centered orthopedics. Using advanced imaging and personalization capabilities, we have enabled orthopedic surgeons to choose solutions based on the unique needs of each patient. Such individualization will not only improve the results of treatment, but also reduce the patient's discomfort and speed up the recovery process.
2.optimizing the orthosis manufacturing process: in the past, the orthoses manufacturing process was revolutionized, which took a lot of time and resources. With the help of 3D printing technology, we can take the time to create orthoses 20
 
we reduced it to an hour. This efficiency not only benefits patients, but also reduces the burden on medical workers, ensuring the availability and timeliness of Orthopedic Care.
3.complex components of orthoses: our path has revealed the important importance of orthosis components and compound models. Thanks to our experience and perseverance, we have made progress in overcoming difficulties and creating orthoses that easily fit into the user's body. Although there were mistakes along the way, each one was a valuable lesson that led us to achieve the final result.
4.expanding the boundaries of 3D printing: our research on 3D printing technology has revealed its great potential in orthopedics. We have used various 3D printing technologies such as stereolithographic apparatus (SLA), sediment modeling (FDM), selective laser sintering (SLS) and cathode ray melting (EBM) to create orthoses of unparalleled complexity and design. This technological versatility has opened up new horizons for the creation of orthopedic solutions aimed at a particular patient.
Standing on the threshold of orthopedic innovation, we understand that our work is only the beginning. The future promises us even greater achievements and improvements. The continuous development of 3D printing technology is the key to unlocking these possibilities.
